Hi, I'm Dhruv, an engineer passionate about research in blockchain, cryptography, and decentralized systems. My interests include Zero Knowledge , Modular Blockchain, and DeFi.

Currently, I’m experimenting & building systems in Rust, deepening my understanding of protocols and core ethereum architecture. As a three-time ETHGlobal finalist and a frequent hackathon participant, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible.

I like travelling and photography, and I'm always up for a good conversation about the latest in tech or engineering. Feel free to reach out.
