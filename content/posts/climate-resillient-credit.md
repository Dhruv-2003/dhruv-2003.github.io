# Introduction

Imagine a loan that adapts to the weather. That’s the simple idea I’m exploring today using weather‑conditioned tokens as collateral to give small farmers a financial buffer when they need it most. Inspired by the [Multiverse Finance](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/05/multiverse-finance) concept by Dave White at Paradigm, this is a use‑case I specced out while applying for the Paradigm Fellowship. Multiverse Finance lets you create verses (parallel universes) that only have value if specific conditions are met, conditional money that disappears if the condition fails. Let me show you how I think it might work and why it could actually help farmers instead of just creating another betting market.

# The Challenge

For smallholder farmers, income isn’t just seasonal — it’s unpredictable. One year’s monsoon can mean a good harvest; a slightly delayed or brief rain can spell disaster.

The downside here is much worse than the upside is good. A bad weather year can wipe out a farmer's entire income and push them into debt, while a good year might only provide modest gains above normal. Traditional loans make this asymmetry worse by demanding repayment regardless of outcomes.

So what if the credit system itself could be flexible, responsive to the climate instead of rigid ?

# The Idea

Here’s the core concept of Weather-Conditioned Collateral, instead of ordinary collateral, farmers enter a “verse” tied to weather outcomes. For instance:

**LowRain Verse** - where LowRainUSD tokens are worth 1$ and verse survives only if total rainfall in the season is below, say, 20 cm.

Farmer uses these tokens as collateral to borrow from other participants in the same verse. Everyone in this verse is betting on the same weather outcome. If rain is scarce (bad harvest), the verse survives, both collateral and debt remain valid, giving the farmer liquidity when they need it most. If rain is abundant (good harvest), the entire verse disappears, collateral, debt, everything vanishes.

# How It Plays Out

Inside a verse, tokens behave in a very particular way: **1 LowRainUSD = $1 only if the verse survives**. That makes the setup look speculative at first glance, the farmer is essentially declaring _“I think drought is a real possibility”_ when they mint these tokens.

But this isn't the farmer betting against themselves. Think of it as insurance, that pays out exactly when drought hurts them most. This flips the traditional risk model: instead of being vulnerable when weather goes wrong, farmers are protected when they need it most.

Let’s walk through two clear outcomes:

1. **Worst‑Case (Low Rainfall):**
   - Drought Happens, so the verse survives.
   - Collateral (LowRainUSD) remains valid, as does the borrowed amount.
   - The farmer still holds liquidity despite a poor harvest.
2. **Best‑Case (High Rainfall):**
   - Verse disappears
   - Neither collateral nor loan hold.
   - The farmer loses just the initial collateral but reaps a full harvest.

# Why It matters

This approach offers several advantages:

- It removes liquidation risk during bad harvests, loans vanish with collateral if the verse doesn’t hold.
- It shifts credit from being rigid to being **belief-driven**: farmers borrow based on their informed view of the season.
- For lenders, the logic is just as clear: they only lend when they think a verse is likely to survive, and they accept that in “bad worlds” their lent amount disappears

# Closing notes & Future Work

This is just one example of how Multiverse Finance could stretch beyond speculative trading into real-world applications. I'm excited about exploring how crypto primitives might unlock resilience for communities most exposed to risk.

There are several design challenges to work through, like what tokens farmers should borrow against their weather collateral, how to price these tokens before weather outcomes are known, and making the mechanics simple enough for real-world use.

If you're working on similar problems, or have thoughts on making this more practical, I'd love to hear from you.
