    </div>

    I have a problem. I really like being good at things, and dislike being bad at them. Unfortunately, I am not all that good at most things. I have my niches yes, but in general there are a lot of things I want to do that I am not immediately good at and thus struggle to like &amp; do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This was starting to weigh on me the last couple of years. I noticed it holding me back from doing things I could plausibly really enjoy. I found myself shying away from going to events and meeting people for fear of leaving a bad impression; avoiding everything from running longer distances to upping the stakes at poker nights with my friends.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had a big mindset shift on this issue this year and have decided to document it here in case it is helpful for anyone else. At the very least, it will be interesting for my future self to look back on and see if/how my thinking has shifted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's back up a little bit, and talk about something slightly different. At the start of the year, I committed to a college — a college I'm pretty excited about — full of people I’d be predisposed to be good friends with, due to self-selection effects. For the first time in my 12 years of schooling, searching for global max friends — the people I would most feel at home with — felt like a mission truly worth pursuing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To have the best chance of finding the best people for me, I should try to meet as many people as I can, to explore as much of the search space as possible. However, I realized that without some changes, come fall, my strong aversion to negative stimuli would result in me cowering away from trying new things which would be essential for meeting new people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I set out to address that. Inspired by a CGP Grey video (I know, a little embarrassing), I labeled this year the Year of Adventure. This entailed committing myself to one simple policy: at any decision crossroads where one option feels more adventurous, lean towards exploring that one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To cut to the chase, this rule has worked out really well for me. Over the past 6 months, I’ve done a lot of things I never would have done in the past. I wanted my local library to stay open later, so I went to an LA County Board of Library Commissioners meeting and petitioned for it. I asked out my long-time crush, danced horribly in front of 100 strangers, went in blind to an informatics tournament, pitched 4 horrible startup ideas to some of my Twitter idols, skied down my first double black diamond, and then 3 more the next day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the time I came up to San Francisco for the summer, my Year of Adventure instincts had become automatic. I spent my first weekend at <a href="https://www.manifest.is/">Manifest</a>, where I met a bunch of really wonderful people with some of whom I made the pact binding me to write this very post. At Manifest I did a lot of things I was bad at — I danced, I wrestled (a bit), I talked to people I looked up to for years and embarrassed myself tripping over my words — but even as I failed over and over, I realized those days at Manifest were some of the happiest and most accomplished-feeling of my life.

    It wasn’t because I had suddenly become good at any of these things, nor really was it because I had overcome my desire to be good at things and fear of being bad. Rather, I had subconsciously shifted my internal "good/bad attempt scoring function" if you will, to measure this sort of higher-order goal of being adventurous. With this mindset, being shit at poker or failing at finger-jousting no longer made a day a failure, but instead a huge success. I chose a path of most resistance and managed to find joy in it, even if going bust or being thrown to the ground still sucked in the moment. If I wasn’t bad at it, I probably wasn't being adventurous enough when I chose to do it.

    I'm not sure how long this reframe will last in my brain and whether it will hedonically adapt to this too but, at least so far, it’s been very fulfilling. I think I'm much less averse to negative stimuli now as a result of this regime, and I’ve already met some people who have a high chance of being really important to me for many years to come. Future global max friends, watch out, I’m coming for you :3
    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">TL;DR:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you want to meet cool people, make adventurousness your policy; it's a good razor.</li>
        <li>This may also solve the issue of finding it hard to enjoy things you're not good at — you can switch to judging yourself on if you were sufficiently adventurous, instead of success.</li>
